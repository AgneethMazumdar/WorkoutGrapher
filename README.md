# Purpose

This script parses through the contents of a training spreedsheet (csv) and graphs the userâ€™s progress given an input of a minimum set and rep scheme. This can be applicable in analyzing the training log of a powerlifter, weightlifter, or a general weight training enthusiast. 

# Requirements

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) 
* [NumPy] (http://www.numpy.org/)
* [matplotlib] (http://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn] (http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/installing.html)

# CSV File Formatting

An example of a month's worth of test data. The script will ignore empty cells but improperly formatted cells will result in errors. If you wanted to read two separate rep and set schemes from a single cell that will result in error, so it's best to choose one that you would like to graph.
